# Quick Start

## Installation

```bash
npm install @tailor-platform/app-shell
```

## Setup

Add the `AppShell` component as the root of your application. Define your pages as modules and resources — AppShell manages routing, sidebar navigation, and breadcrumbs automatically.

```tsx
import { AppShell, SidebarLayout, defineModule, defineResource } from "@tailor-platform/app-shell";

const productsModule = defineModule({
  path: "products",
  component: () => <div>Products</div>,
  resources: [
    defineResource({
      path: ":id",
      component: () => <div>Product Detail</div>,
    }),
  ],
});

const App = () => (
  <AppShell title="My App" basePath="dashboard" modules={[productsModule]}>
    <SidebarLayout />
  </AppShell>
);
```

Mount AppShell's Tailwind theme in your CSS:

```css
/* globals.css */
@import "@tailor-platform/app-shell/theme.css";
@import "tailwindcss";
```

This gives you:

- Sidebar navigation with "Products" as a menu item
- Routing to `/dashboard/products` and `/dashboard/products/:id`
- Breadcrumb trail navigation
- Light/dark theming
