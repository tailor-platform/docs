# ActivityCard

The `ActivityCard` component displays a timeline of recent activities (e.g. changes on a PO, SO, or GR document). Each entry shows an avatar, user name, description, and timestamp. A limited number of activities are shown in the card; additional activities are available via a clickable overflow that opens a dialog with a scrollable full list.

## Import

```tsx
import {
  ActivityCard,
  type ActivityCardActivity,
  type ActivityCardProps,
} from "@tailor-platform/app-shell";
```

Use `ActivityCardActivity` for each item in your activities array (or infer from `ActivityCardProps["activities"][number]`).

## Basic Usage

```tsx
const activities = [
  {
    id: "1",
    actor: { name: "Hanna", avatarUrl: "/avatars/hanna.jpg" }, // avatarUrl is optional
    description: "changed the status from DRAFT to CONFIRMED",
    timestamp: new Date("2025-03-21T09:00:00"),
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    actor: { name: "Pradeep Kumar" },
    description: "created this PO",
    timestamp: new Date("2025-03-21T15:16:00"),
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    // no actor — system event with no specific subject
    description: "Status automatically changed to EXPIRED",
    timestamp: new Date("2025-03-20T10:00:00"),
  },
];

export function DocumentUpdates() {
  return <ActivityCard activities={activities} title="Updates" />;
}
```

## Overflow and dialog

By default the card shows the 6 most recent activities. If there are more, a button appears at the bottom (e.g. **"2 more activities"**). Clicking it opens a modal dialog titled "All activities" with the full list in a scrollable area. The overflow label can be switched to a count style (**"+2"**) via the `overflowLabel` prop.

```tsx
<ActivityCard activities={manyActivities} title="Updates" maxVisible={6} overflowLabel="more" />
// or overflowLabel="count" for "+N"
```

## Grouping by day

Set `groupBy="day"` to group activities under labels like "TODAY", "YESTERDAY", or a formatted date.

```tsx
<ActivityCard activities={activities} title="Updates" groupBy="day" />
```

## Props

| Prop            | Type                     | Default  | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `activities`    | `ActivityCardActivity[]` | required | List of activities (newest first).                |
| `title`         | `string`                 | -        | Card title, e.g. "Updates".                       |
| `maxVisible`    | `number`                 | `6`      | Max activities shown in the card before overflow. |
| `overflowLabel` | `"more" \| "count"`      | `"more"` | "N more activities" vs "+N".                      |
| `groupBy`       | `"none" \| "day"`        | `"none"` | Optional grouping by day.                         |
| `className`     | `string`                 | -        | Applied to the card root.                         |

Each activity must include: `id`, `description`, `timestamp` (Date or string). Optional: `actor` (`{ name, avatarUrl? }`) — omit for system events with no specific actor (initials fallback when `avatarUrl` is absent).
