# Introduction

> **AppShell gives you everything you need to build production-ready ERP applications on Tailor Platform with minimal configuration.**

## What is AppShell?

AppShell is a React-based framework that provides the foundation for building custom ERP applications on Tailor Platform. It handles the complex infrastructure so you can focus on building business-level screens and features.

### Key Features

#### 🚀 Module-based Routing

Define routes through modules and resources instead of file-based routing. Get automatic sidebar navigation and breadcrumbs out of the box.

→ [Learn about Modules & Resources](concepts/modules-and-resources)

#### 🔒 Built-in Authentication

OAuth2/OIDC integration with Tailor Platform's Auth service. Supports any configured IdP including Google, Okta, and Auth0.

→ [Authentication Guide](concepts/authentication)

#### 🎨 Beautiful UI Components

Responsive layouts, description cards, command palette, and more. Built with Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui principles.

→ [Component Library](components/app-shell)

#### 🔌 ERP Module Integration

Connect compatible ERP modules like PIM, SO, MO with automatic data provider to Tailor's application gateway.

→ [Installation Guide](installation)

## Out of the Box

When you integrate AppShell into your React application, you get:

- ✅ **Simple composition** - Compose custom Tailor-powered, React-based ERP applications with minimal code
- ✅ **User authentication** - Complete OAuth2 flow with token management and session persistence
- ✅ **Authorization** - Route guards for permission-based and role-based access control
- ✅ **Module system** - Organize your app with modules and resources that auto-generate navigation
- ✅ **Beautiful layouts** - Responsive, opinionated layouts with sidebar navigation and breadcrumbs
- ✅ **Convenience hooks** - Access application, module, and user contexts with React hooks
- ✅ **Data integration** - Automatic data provider to Tailor's application gateway

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **React 19+** (React 18+ is supported but React 19 is recommended)
- **Node 16 or higher**
- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript/TypeScript

## Quick Example

Here's a minimal AppShell application:

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { AppShell, SidebarLayout, defineModule } from "@tailor-platform/app-shell";

const dashboardModule = defineModule({
  path: "dashboard",
  component: () => <h1>Welcome to AppShell!</h1>,
  meta: {
    title: "Dashboard",
  },
  resources: [],
});

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AppShell title="My ERP App" basePath="app" modules={[dashboardModule]}>
      <SidebarLayout />
    </AppShell>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```css
/* globals.css */
@import "@tailor-platform/app-shell/theme.css";
@import "tailwindcss";
```

That's it! AppShell will:

- ✅ Render your module in the sidebar navigation
- ✅ Handle routing to `/app/dashboard`
- ✅ Display breadcrumb navigation
- ✅ Apply Tailor's design system
